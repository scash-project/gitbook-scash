# Roadmap

Today, Scash is compatible with Bitcoin network consensus rules. Adding support for Scash to existing Bitcoin related software and infrastructure requires minimal effort.  See the [protocol spec](https://github.com/scash-project/sips/blob/main/scash-protocol-spec.md) for more details.

In the future, it is possible there could be a network upgrade to deploy a significant feature which is not on Bitcoin Core's roadmap, thus moving away from full compatibility with Bitcoin network consensus rules.

Areas of interest and research include:

* Block finality
* Zero confirmation transaction experience
* Interoperability with EVM chains
* Application of FHE and ZK
