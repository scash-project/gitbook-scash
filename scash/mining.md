# Mining

Scash uses [RandomX](https://github.com/tevador/RandomX) as it's proof of work, enabling anyone with a computer to mine blocks and help secure the network.

RandomX was first deployed on the Monero network in 2019 and has successfully prevented the development of specialized ASIC mining equipment.

For more information about RandomX, see video below.
