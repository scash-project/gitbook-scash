# Mission

Scash is an experimental cryptocurrency based on the Bitcoin protocol.

* Continues the mission of providing the world with a P2P electronic cash system.
* Restores home computer mining
  * Onboards people directly into the system, without the need for fiat onramps
  * Decentralizes mining, making the system more censorship resistant

Scash is focused on value transfer i.e. payments sent directly from one party to another without going through a trusted third party, as described in the Bitcoin white paper.

Scash will always defend home computer mining and upgrade the network as necessary.
